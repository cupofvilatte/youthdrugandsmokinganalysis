# Overview

I want to be more aware of and engaged in data usage. In my belief, a perfect way to become comfortable with a concept is to work with it. I have worked some in SQL before, and I have also worked a bit in Python. However, while these hard skills are definitely valuable, the countless soft skills to offer are also lucrative. I am developing my critical thinking by choosing an article myself. It also helps me, as a conscious being, to be ever so slightly more grounded in what is going on and force myself to learn about data.

For this project I analyzed a dataset about drug and tobacco use across races and genders. The dataset includes many fields. Some of the important ones which have not yet been mentioned are age, family background, and mental health. There are many other categories. I like this about the dataset because it has a lot of opportunity to be advanced with more details and unique questions.

My purpose in analyzing this data is to come to a personal understanding of the realtions between youth and drugs today. It is a critical issue. I believe that by understanding the root cause, we can work to fight against the disease, instead of just fighting the symptoms.

# Data Analysis Results

## Question 1 - What gender is more likely to smoke? Form a hypothesis about why this might be the case.
- Based on this study, Females are more likely to smoke, but the difference is so slight that it may reasonably be dismissed. I think this is an interesting find, as it is not what I would have expected. I would have expected men to be far more likely to smoke than women. In some way, this goes to show the biases we may have against men in our culture, to assume that they are more likely to be involved in harmful activities such as drug, tobacco, and alchohol abuse.
- I would like to note that research I did on drug use in preparatoin for this study suggested that men are more likely to use tobacco. In a further study I would like to understand better the conditions of this data to understand what causes this shift, even if it seems slight.


## Question 2 - What difference is made, and to what degree, based on a difference in school activity involvement?
- There was about a 1.4% percent difference. This number seems small, but compared to the scope of the data, which has 10000 rows, a slight shift such as this is significant, because 1.4% of 10000 is around 140, which is quite a few more. We notice this change occurs such that those who are not involved in school programs are more likely to experiment with drugs.
- I would like to note, to give charity to those who don't attend school programs, that the shift is, once again, not as dramatic as I would have expected. Students can find uplifting things to do that are not sponsored by their school.

## Question 3 - How do mental health and drug experimentation correlate?
- The results from this study show little-to-no relation. These results confused me more than any others. In a deeper study I would like to understand the intricacies of how these parts work together. I would think there to be a very high correlation. Perhaps there are just stronger forces at work when it comes to dragging young people down in such a manner. Perhaps I would consider how factors such as wealth and Substance Education affect these.

# Development Environment

I used VSCODE to build my project as it hosts Python exceedingly well. GitHub was also a primary helper in the role of this project, for the maintanance and ability to share and host code.

I used the Python language and the pandas and plotly library. Python is a common and versatile language for dealing with data. The data I dealt with was in csv for this project. There is also a txt file which contains my questions and answers, but the Python does not need to access this. Because of these things, the pandas library worked well for my project. Plotly was recommended to me by a fellow classmate and I have found it to be extremely useful and fun once you take the time to learn it.

# Future Work

* Ask questions about other forces, specifically peer pressure, and its effect on drug-experimentation.
* Create more lovely graphs which are unified either as pop-ups or web pages.
* Optimize code by building functions that reduce overused code.
